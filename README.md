This app doesn't have a license, but it doesn't mean it can be used freely. Here's what GitHub says about it :
"Generally speaking, the absence of a license means that the default copyright laws apply. This means that you retain all rights to your source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. This might not be what you intend."

In fact, that's what I intend. You can look at the code and learn from it, but YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO COPY, REPRODUCE OR PUBLISH THIS CODE ON YOUR OWN NAME.
